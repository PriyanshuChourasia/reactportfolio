Hii, I am  **Priyanshu Chourasia** Software developer, who grinding hard in development field to gain more and more knowledge. I have studied Mechanical Engineering and I will give you a little flashback how I got into all this.

So,  In 6th semester of my college I had a subject call IOT  `Internet of Things` which pulled me into computer engineering more and then I started digging deep and got to learn coding from a wonderful and passionate man. His way of teaching pulled me more in this subject. Now I am a software developer.
